Hello, welcome to my academic webpage! 

I'm broadly interested in understanding, modeling and simulating the mechanics and thermodynamics of solids, at both the atomic and continuum scales, wave propagation in solids, topology optimization, scientific computing, and machine learning in computational mechanics. You will find more details about my research, teaching, and students working with me here.
