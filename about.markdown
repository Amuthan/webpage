## About Me

I grew up in the small town of [Pondicherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) in the southern part of India. I love learning and playing with new ideas in mathematics, physics, and scientific computing. Outside academic research, I enjoy listening to [Carnatic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music) (the classical music of south India), and occassionally play it on the fretless electric guitar. I also like hanging out with animals, especially dogs and cats--I have two beautiful cats that my wife and I adopted from Cat Cafe Studio in Versova (Mumbai, India).
